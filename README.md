# TelescopeX

Description  

We are a team of high schoolers who live, and are good at game making. We all are WOW-ed  by capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope. In addition to coding, we have 3D modeling skills with fusion 360. So using our diverse sets of skills and experience, this project builds interesting game connected with JWST in order to showcase its amazing design and satisfying. 
.
The name of our team means Sunset. 
And knowing the history of the JWST telescope and the fact that NASA has not recognized this project many times, we decided to name the team this way in honor of James Webb. After all, sunset is proof that the end can also be beautiful.
.
We came up with a game related to the James Webb Telescope. A game that contains 2 Modes. The gameâ€™s interface is rotating telescope animation. When the player starts the game, he looks through the lens, on the 1st person mode. 1 Mode - for planetary exploration. So you can see the structure of the solar system. You can also zoom and scroll the screen in all directions (horizontally, vertically and diagonally). And you can also get relevant information about the planet. If you point the telescope at Venus, you can see its temperature, its distance from the Sun, its duration, its radius, its type). 2nd Mode - provides the ability to receive information about planets, as well as travel through the solar system. 
.
Our entire project was done on the Unity program and written in C#. 3D models of Planets and the solar system, the rear view, the James Webb telescope and all the objects we did on the program itself and on Fusion 360.
.
Our project web site provides instruction videos and ready-to-run programs; anyone interested can immediately learn how to play  and get relevant knowledges about telescope. We hope you find this project interesting and useful and then learn about something about JWST. JWST has been already launched. Let's get to know about it and observe its unique capabilities.
